# Shell And Lifecycle

This supplement is normative only for its bounded beryl-app shell and lifecycle role and is
governed by [design.md](design.md). It does not independently declare engineering rigor.

## Process Service Graph And Windows

- One ordinary process service graph is constructed only after the configured Beryl home validates.
  A busy home creates only its compact surface, and an unreadable home creates no ordinary
  conversation window from unvalidated state.
- The graph composes typed home domains, health and readiness publishers, runtime/root services,
  bounded catalog and activity services, settings and theme services, durable-job coordinators,
  and explicitly bounded worker pools. Shared versioned facts never retain or mutate GPUI views.
- The graph also owns the bounded execution-session registry and shared shutdown coordinator
  defined by the [CAS-live system](../../../doc/systems/cas-live-syndic-transcript/design.md).
  These services retain exact execution custody without window handles and publish bounded
  running-thread and needs-attention pages to independent window subscribers.
- The validated home service graph constructs exactly one marker-seal service for each home
  generation with immutable limits. Windows and publication flights receive clones sharing its
  flight registry and capacity. Construction is restricted to home composition; consumers do not
  rediscover the service through a process-global registry. Graph retirement freezes admission and
  completes the existing disposal and generation-retirement protocol before replacement; dropping
  shared handles alone is not that protocol.
- `beryl-app` is the sole GPUI shell-composition boundary described by
  [GUI integration](../../../doc/gui/integration.md). Feature controllers mount only into declared
  windows and slots.
- Each main window owns one controller, `WindowId`, exact selected-thread claim, bounded navigation
  and transient interaction state, composer host, transcript host, and presentation projections.
  No main-window controller or GPUI entity is shared between windows.
- Selection and nonfinal close release only view/editor/subscription ownership after the required
  flush and durable claim/session transaction. They do not dispose an execution session or cancel
  its accepted queue, pending request, compaction, or continuation. Attaching a running thread
  obtains presentation subscriptions and GUI occupancy without waiting for execution checkout.
- Construction checks the stable process main-window count before allocating the controller or OS
  window. The [main-windows feature](../../../doc/features/main-windows/design.md) owns capacity and
  visible creation, close, Exit, and restore behavior. One admitted construction may retain its
  exact unpublished OS window and controller only through bounded preparation to first publication
  or prepublication abandonment; the app creates no overflow, parked, or deferred hidden
  controller.
- Settings, busy-home, and home-failure windows are distinct top-level controllers and never receive
  main-window claims or restore records.

## Startup And Activation

- Startup accepts only the validated minimal session plus each restored window's selected thread,
  current draft, visible range, compact editor frontier, transcript seed, and placement facts. It
  retains bounded seeds and never preloads a complete draft or history.
- Later activation prepares one revision-consistent target bundle containing claim, durable draft
  selector, fresh candidate-session head, composer and transcript seeds, title, lineage,
  runtime/root, and window-local projection facts.
- Each window owns at most one unpublished target composer. The prior coherent selection remains
  authoritative until promotion fences and flushes it and publishes the complete target bundle.
- Cancellation, preparation failure, source drift, stale completion, rejection, supersession, or
  disposal releases the unpublished target and preserves the complete prior bundle. An unmutated
  fresh target is abandoned only through the typed Syndic boundary; a mutated or ambiguous target
  stays in its ordinary operation or reconciliation custody.
- Startup and activation presentation follow the
  [conversation-threads feature](../../../doc/features/conversation-threads/design.md); this
  package owns only typed preparation, fencing, and publication.

## Window Detachment And Process Shutdown

- Ordinary close and application Exit are coordinated with process window construction through
  one bounded admission gate. The app revalidates whether a closing window is final before
  admitting shutdown or durably removing it; overlapping closes cannot each assume another
  window will survive. Confirmation carries exact attempt, window-set, and work revisions and
  owns no stop or mutation authority until the shared shutdown coordinator admits the barrier.
- The shutdown coordinator freezes all execution/successor cuts, joins exact process-owned work,
  preserves durable queue custody, and composes resident-preserving draft flush with typed session
  publication. It retains windows and claims until success, then joins service/runtime disposal
  before process exit. Explicit Exit and final ordinary close retain their distinct restore modes.
- A failed barrier releases interaction gates from the retained coherent state without restoring
  cancelled continuations or repeating possible dispatch. Closing a settings or auxiliary window
  never becomes the final-main-window execution barrier.

## Prepublication Window Abandonment

- The app admits abandonment only for an exact acquired main window that has not been published
  visible. Once visibility is published, only the separately owned ordinary-close and Exit
  lifecycles apply.
- `WindowId` is the sole operation and bounded-flight identity. Private fixed operation facts bind
  the exact acquisition fingerprint; they authorize no substitute thread, draft, runtime, root,
  placement, disposition, or fresh operation identity.
- One shared process registry admits at most 256 window acquisition or abandonment flights and at
  most one flight per `WindowId`, with no resident wait queue. Definitive settlement releases the
  exact entry; indeterminate and pending reconciliation retain it.
- The app composes the typed session, catalog, durable-job, and Syndic participants into one
  `HomeCommand`. It neither inspects package-private records nor performs a compensating cleanup
  command. A reused pristine thread is validation-only; a created fallback contributes the typed
  authenticated pristine-deletion mutation.
- App abandonment and reconciliation custody is opaque, move-only, and retained across
  cancellation and acknowledgement loss until exact classification. `NotCommitted` returns the
  same abandonment custody, committed or exact-abandoned settles it, and indeterminate transfers it
  synchronously into the sole reconciliation owner. Pending reconciliation returns that same owner;
  exact-acquired returns retry custody; collision grants no cleanup authority.
- Natural reconciliation combines only bounded State and Syndic observations bracketed by equal
  home-revision reads and returns exact acquired, exact abandoned, or collision. Revision drift is
  retried within a fixed bound; exhaustion preserves custody. A fresh same-home service uses stable
  operation facts and fresh typed handles rather than an old-generation capability, and it never
  guesses completion from missing or partial state.

## Typed Home Integration

- The package never opens Fjall, reads raw keyspaces, or constructs storage encodings. It receives
  typed domain handles, repositories, revisions, and command outcomes.
- Service configuration supplies a nonzero minimum capture reserve to `beryl-home-store` and
  receives the home-store-owned opaque turn-start space requirement after dependency validation.
  The app neither knows nor recreates the dependency's fixed budget arithmetic.
- Direct submission and accepted-input promotion pass that same opaque requirement intact to the
  typed free-space query. Callers cannot provide a path-specific or pre-aggregated total.
- Correctness-sensitive success is published only after the typed home command's required durability
  barrier. Health transition invalidates mutation authority by generation while windows may retain
  only last coherent inert presentation.

## Same-Home Replacement Contribution

- `beryl-app` contributes one complete unpublished app service graph to the process-wide same-home
  replacement. Before candidate construction, the old graph fences admission and disposes its
  connections, brokers, routers, schedulers, projections, leases, workers, custody, subscriptions,
  and service-local handles; none transfers.
- Candidate construction, durable convergence, and supervisor attachment remain unpublished. The
  app exposes the candidate only through outer atomic whole-stack publication.
- Failure before publication disposes the candidate and publishes no authority. After publication,
  schedulers and projection consumers establish fresh authority from durable typed facts under the
  new generation.
