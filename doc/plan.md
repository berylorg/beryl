# Scope

Resume Checkpoint 4 of the Beryl-home architectural rework tracked by
`doc/rework/beryl-home/REWORK.md`. Protect concrete supported-envelope consequences without
duplicating dependency guarantees, runtime validation, or review machinery.

Preserve the architecture that has real product cost and purpose: bounded GUI/editor/transcript
streaming, explicit Beryl-owned resource limits, atomic durable mutation, exact acknowledgement-loss
reconciliation, Syndic/CAS identity and external-effect fencing, cross-domain asset proof, and
bounded recovery. Do not infer whole-store validation, continuous semantic proof, blanket
adversarial review, arbitrary-scale support, or duplicated consumer checks from persistence or an
unqualified verification requirement.

Keep only this bounded cleanup and draft-marker slice in the durable plan. Later GUI, repair,
recovery, branch, asset, integration, and closure boundaries remain represented by the active
rework tracker until their own bounded slices are ready. Functional checks run normally; sustained
stress or performance work requires a concrete unresolved question and prior Operator AC-power
coordination.

# Phase 225: Integrate Exact Ordinary Draft-Marker Writer Admission (finished)

Integrated proof-bound ordinary marker-changing begin, exact target point consumption, empty/zero
atomic adoption, durable terminal reclamation, outcome-owned acknowledgement reconciliation, and
fresh-generation cleanup-only fencing without admitting marker work through text/direct-builder
paths. The final durable-builder and Phase 213/218/220/222/223/224/225 regression passed 87/87,
all-target checks passed, and fresh independent semantic review found no remaining issue or needless
production complexity.

# Phase 226: Integrate Exact Historical Draft-Marker Adoption (pending)

Resolve the historical target entirely inside Syndic, authenticate its retained lineage, root,
marker commitment, selection, and protection containment, then adopt it without ordinary readiness,
reservation, Asset participation, marker scan, or history scan. Verify stale, missing, substituted,
collision, cancellation, and acknowledgement-uncertain outcomes with focused tests and independent
semantic review.
