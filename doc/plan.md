# Scope

Production marker admission and canonical widget publication have passed acceptance with the LLVM, one-job,
no-normal-debug and nonincremental settings under the root
[technology decisions](design.md#implementation-technology). The Operator authorizes pushing projects and owned forks as needed for
this work, including the accepted widget revision and Beryl changes. Preserve required
checks and independent review while using conditional delegation and bounded evidence.

Keep GUI thread switching clean without overengineering. The two authorized non-GUI corrections,
marker admission and healthy scheduler-conflict handling, are accepted. The Operator's instruction to
continue implementation resumes process-provider composition and the remaining phases below.
The controlling contracts are [conversation threads](features/conversation-threads/design.md),
[backend recovery](features/backend-runtime-recovery/design.md), and the
[app package](../crates/beryl-app/doc/design.md). Complete process composition, Running threads,
final-window shutdown and other broader background-work requirements remain separate rework work.

The Operator authorizes continuous implementation until a blocker requires attention, with a
commit after each accepted phase. Temporary-directory deletion and obsolete-directory cleanup
remain authorized; verify exact targets and preserve unrelated or concurrent work. The active
Beryl-home architectural replacement remains tracked by [REWORK.md](rework/beryl-home/REWORK.md).
The former window-owned stop/wait plan is superseded. Previously accepted exact-stop,
continuation-cancellation, draft-flush and session primitives are reusable evidence, not authority
for stopping a background thread when a nonfinal view closes.

Continue in the current conversation thread; do not request new-thread handoffs.

At every phase boundary, explain any blocker directly to the Operator and suggest concrete next
steps. Evidence links supplement that explanation rather than replacing it.

Apply the [simplification audit](audits/code-simplification/report.md) selectively within each
owning acceptance boundary. It is evidence, not authority or a second plan; preserve its baseline
estimates and record actual dispositions only for accepted selected findings. Separate an
independently implementable simplification or material scope growth before work begins. Keep
source names behavior-based and follow the canonical single GPUI graph. No compatibility shell,
universal resource governor, or compile-only substitute fulfills target behavior.

The final shell mounts every declared slot and feature contribution using accepted target
services and widgets. Leave deferred contributions visibly absent or unavailable until their
bounded implementation is accepted. Startup, restoration, Exit/close mounting, catalog,
transcript, Running threads, attention, approval-policy reconciliation, Settings, repair, recovery,
branch, assets and bootstrap remain explicit rework checkpoints. Preserve their separate gates.

The Operator selected [fatal crash reporting](features/crash-reporting/design.md) with a separate
reporter process and immediate failed-application termination, explicitly requiring restrained
complexity. The [system boundary](systems/crash-reporting/design.md) supersedes the proposed
in-process panic-recovery correction. Establish its bounded components before returning to CAS
regression reconciliation; final production mounting remains dependent on executable bootstrap.

The Operator authorizes defining and reconstructing target executable bootstrap. Establish the
private home candidate and its typed consumers, explicit recovery access and prepared service
composition before restore-set and native process-entry integration. Preserve each separate
acceptance boundary and the intentional removal gaps; complete registration alone does not accept
the service graph or visible startup.

# Phase 463: Reconcile Service Prerequisites With Product Mounting (finished)

Accepted the Operator-approved prerequisite order with separate recovery component, complete graph,
full-stack recovery and product-mounting gates. Independent review, link/diff checks and Markdown
index reconciliation passed. [Evidence](failures/target-bootstrap-composition.md#durable-job-factory-readiness).

# Phase 464: Establish Exact Pinned Terminal Repair Evidence (pending)

Resolve the remaining exact 0.146.0 processor/reducer proof required by the
[repair contract](systems/cas-live-syndic-transcript/design.md#exact-terminal-turn-historical-repair).
Inspect exact pinned source and generated schemas for one descending full-item terminal turn,
identity synthesis, terminal-status normalization, cursors and generated media; distinguish proven
semantic final state from live-event evidence. Update the existing pinned repair investigation,
obtain independent source review, and classify the authorized route as proven or unavailable.
This evidence boundary authorizes no adapter, backend request or history fallback.

# Phase 465: Implement The Private Exact Terminal Repair Adapter (pending)

After phase 464 proves the route and its implementation prerequisites are ready, implement the
bounded one-request adapter with exact target/capability admission, streaming closed-item output
and typed failure. Verify no successor race, cursor follow, retry, alternate history route or
partial publication; keep durable dispatch custody and runtime mounting separate. Remaining
recovery and branch components continue to feed bounded phases from the rework tracker before 423.

# Phase 423: Publish The Complete Initial App Service Graph (pending)

After every required service factory is independently accepted, compose and publish the complete
private graph with the same home generation, then release ordinary workers. Verify last-constructor
failure, cancellation, startup convergence and publication rejection with full cleanup ownership.
This integration cannot absorb missing service implementations or accept restored GUI visibility.
Theme preparation and candidate managed-session configuration are accepted.
Finish the remaining graph-factory inventory before activating this phase.

Prerequisite gap identified on 2026-09-16: the required durable-job coordinator is not implemented. The current
ordinary tool dispatcher explicitly refuses branch resolution; typed durable-job records and
read-only process-work inventory do not implement handoff recovery or execution. The rework gate
now admits non-GUI recovery prerequisites before branch handoff and complete graph publication,
separately from product mounting. Finish those service gates before activating this phase; do not
publish a partial graph or substitute an inert service. See
[factory readiness evidence](failures/target-bootstrap-composition.md#durable-job-factory-readiness).

# Phase 415: Specify Restore-Set Startup Composition (pending)

Resolve exact restoration custody, complete-set first visibility, threadless empty-session startup,
placement and native process-lifetime composition in owning authority, using the accepted session,
window and graceful-shutdown components. Derive bounded implementation phases before wiring the
ordinary executable. The [bootstrap readiness evidence](failures/target-bootstrap-composition.md)
identifies the remaining gaps without authorizing alternate startup behavior.

# Phase 382: Mount Crash Reporting At Process Entry (pending)

After target executable bootstrap exists, connect the accepted reporter and GUI boundaries before
ordinary storage/work startup. Verify reserved reporter mode cannot enter normal bootstrap,
ordinary startup installs fatal handling first, normal exit leaves no reporter, and a real
isolated application panic terminates its process while the report remains usable. No helper-only
or library-only evidence accepts this production mount; the current bootstrap removal gap remains
explicit until its owning rework checkpoint closes.

Blocked on 2026-09-15: `crates/beryl/src/main.rs` remains an intentional compile-error placeholder
for the later target bootstrap checkpoint. There is no ordinary executable composition root at
which to mount the accepted reporter and GUI services. Resume after that bootstrap boundary is
specified and reconstructed; do not substitute helper-only evidence or invent an alternate entry.
